<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="./me.jpg" alt="A photo of me">
  <p>My name is Oluyede Chinenye. I am an aspirng Fullstack web developer, <br>currently studying Frontend Development with Altschool.</p>
     <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>My Objectives for this Diploma Course are simple, like any other aspirant developer,<br> but my situation is slightly different from most others. I already have skills in Web<br> Development before signing up for Altschool's course, but it's hard to actually put those <br>skills into action. Hence, my goal is to be a pro at Web Development and be confident in my skills.</p>
